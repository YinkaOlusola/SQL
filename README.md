# SQL Projects

This repository contains a compilation of SQL projects I have worked on.
This repository serves as a collection of SQL projects to showcase my skills in 
querying databases, analyzing data, and generating insights.

Each project includes SQL scripts, queries, and database diagrams 
(known as Entity Relation Diagram - ERD) to demonstrate the database 
structure and functionality.

These projects demonstrate my expertise in working with structured 
databases, performing complex data manipulations, and deriving 
meaningful insights using SQL queries.

It includes SQL scripts, data sources, and any accompanying documentation. 
The repository provides a valuable resource for other data scientists, 
employers, or collaborators to explore and understand my SQL capabilities.

The data used for these projects is in the data folder, and the notebooks used for the projects are equally provided.

**NB:** Some of the files are still a work in progress and will be updated promptly.
